- [ ] `very` : aka very special
- [ ] `better`: a pro pro `beautiful`
- [x] `special`: custom functions and widgets that i like and you maybe wont
- [x] `icky`: my very own keybindings
- [x] `modality`: a SpaceMacs-like way of using leader-based keybindings and modes

- [ ] `colorpicker`: a widget that allows you to pick a color from the screen.
  - it should also show a preview of the color you're picking
  - and it should have a history of colors you've picked
  - and maybe a library of colors you've marked as favorites
- [x] ~~`world times`~~ `meridian` : a widget that shows the time in different places.

- [ ] `shitty` handle errors better (a pro pro naughty)
- [ ] `farty` make art

- [ ] Group modality keypaths when they have duplicated functions.
  - I am realizing that I want a key/path:function system that is function-centric, rather than binding or keypath centric.


- [ ] modality: run previous command (abstracts to history?)
- [ ] jetbrains-toolbox

- [ ] client:mouse stateful memory:

i use the keyboard to move the mouse around because i use it to shift focus
my mouse does not always behave like i expect it to
i would like it to always show up where i last left it for each client
instead of moving to the middle of it
or not coming with me when i switch screens with hints
or not coming with me when i cycle through client.focus history with awesome
or not allowing me to minimize clients?
or not allowing me to move tags on a screen once i've move to a new screen
 because i'm actually still focused, maybe, somehow on the original screen (mouse left behind?)

horizontal magnifier
places the current client in a magnified window
where my current mouse location in the client
is placed in the center of the screen
offscreen allowed
client should remain centered and maximized vertically


modes
fears: debug mode
territorial: move mouse anywhere in three moves

give a visual indication if awesome is running via awmtt or not

WTF

mic widget (and functionality?). frustrated with lain.

modality popup does not show hotkeys for submenus; 
only on the first level (ie root) are hotkeys are shown.
The object that the widget gets (`parent`) does not have (access to?) any of the objects fields that are tables. 
Fields that are strings or numbers are no problem, eg. `bound.n_bindings`, `bound.label`, `bound.fn`.
But `bound.bindings` and `bound.hotkeys` are nil.

alignment does not work properly for the formatting of the `textlines` that are used to represent functions and keybindings
in the search menu (here, `rofi`).


opacity does not work on my computer at all
i installed picom recently

awesome watch self for reloadable, then
load
